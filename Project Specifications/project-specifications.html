    <strong><em>Due: Friday, March 13, 2015, 5PM EST</em></strong>

    <div>
        <h2>Assignment Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The goals of this assignment are to give you an opportunity to gain experience with affine transforms and
            scene graphs, and in designing and implementing interactions that make use of these
            techniques.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>

        <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

        <p>
            In this assignment, you will create a buggy (car) that the user can directly manipulate.
            Specifically, they will be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Position it on the screen by selecting it and dragging it with a pointer,</li>
            <li>Rotate it about its center by dragging the mouse pointer,</li>
            <li>Make it wider or longer by interactively manipulating control points on the car,</li>
            <li>Make the axles longer by interactively pulling the tires out, and</li>
            <li>Turn the car's front wheels by dragging them with the mouse.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You will render the car using an overhead view:
            <img src="assignment_spec_images/buggui_overhead.png" class="center-block img-responsive"/>
            You do not need to make the car "drive" on its own, though you may certainly provide this functionality, if
            you wish.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><em>
                For this assignment, you cannot use any third-party HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or code-generation
                utilities, with the exception of CSS preprocessors and the code provided. You must create all
                HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on your own.
            </em></strong>
        </p>

        <h2>
            Buggui!: Interaction Design
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Canvas Size
        </h3>

        <p>
            For this assignment, you will use an HTML 5 canvas with a size of 800x600 pixels.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Moving, Resizing, and Rotating the Car
        </h3>

        <p>
            The user can directly interact with the car in a number of ways. At the most basic level, they can select
            the car with the pointer and interactively drag it around the screen. They can also rotate the car by
            clicking
            and dragging on the front or back part of the car (but not the bumper). The car should rotate about its
            center.
        </p>

        <p>
            The user can select the front or rear bumper to change the length of the car. However, they may only
            adjust the length within the limits specified below. Similarly, users can click on
            the left or right side of the car to make it wider or narrower (within limits).
        </p>

        <p>
            Resizing the car should uniformly scale the car in the given dimension. For example, if they select
            the front bumper and extend it, it should also extend the back bumper. Similarly, resizing the left
            side of the car should simultaneously resize the right side of the car.
            In essence, you can think of the resizing operation as
            scaling the car about its center, along one dimension or the other (i.e., its length or its width).
        </p>

        <p>
            You should provide clear affordances for resizing and rotating the car. That is, the car's design or
            the interface should
            clearly communicate to the user that they can manipulate the car's length and width, or that they
            can rotate the car. This design should
            be elegant and intuitive. Test with others to ensure you have a good design.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Interacting with the Tires and Axles
        </h3>

        <p>
            Users can directly select any of the four tires with a pointer. When they select a tire, they
            can pull them in and out from the car, effectively making the axles longer or shorter. When pulling a
            tire out, all four tires should simultaneously respond.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, when the user selects either front tire, they can swivel them left or right, as if the
            steering wheel was being turned.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>
            Limits
        </h3>

        <p>
            When the user interacts with the car, its properties must stay within the following constraints:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Car length: minimum of 50 pixels, maximum of 200 pixels
            </li>
            <li>
                Car width: minimum of 25 pixels, maximum of 150 pixels
            </li>
            <li>
                Axle widths: The axle width should never be so small that the tires are not visible or selectable.
                The maximum axle width beyond the side of the car is 75 pixels. The axel width should remain
                fixed during resizing of the width or length of the car. Axel width is defined as the distance
                from the side of the car to the center of a tire.
            </li>
            <li>
                Steering the front tires: The front tires may turn no more than 45 degrees in either direction from
                a starting, neutral position (i.e., where they are not turned at all). This gives them a total of
                90 degrees of steering range.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The objects' locations on the car should meet the following specifications:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The axles should be positioned at points that are fixed distances from the top and bottom bumpers.
                This distance from the top and bottom bumpers should be constant, regardless of the length or width
                of the car (even as the user resizes the car's length or width).
            </li>
            <li>
                The tires' centers should be at the end of the axles. Keep in mind that you will also need to consider
                the orientation of tires, since the left and right tires naturally face in different directions.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Constructing the Car Using a Scene Graph
        </h2>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, you will represent the buggy using an overhead view. You will use a <em>scene graph</em>
            to represent the different parts of the buggy.
        </p>

        <p>
            A scene graph is very similar to an interactor tree: You have a root node, child nodes, and so on.
            Each node's location on the screen is described relative to its parent node (with the exception of
            the root node).
        </p>

        <p>
            In this assignment, you will have a root node representing the scene and background, a child representing
            the car body,
            child nodes of the car representing the axles, and tires that are children of the axles. You may also find
            it useful to have separate nodes representing the front and back of the car, and/or the bumpers, too,
            to support the various interactions required.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each node in the scene graph maintains an affine transform that describes its location, orientation, and
            size, relative to
            its parent. This transform will be applied prior to the object painting itself, allowing the object to
            paint itself in it own, local coordinate system. (Note that <em>you</em> will
            need to ensure that this transform is properly applied to the context prior to rendering commencing.)
            Using this architecture, nodes will paint themselves under the following
            assumptions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The car body should paint itself so that its center is at the origin, the headlights are in the
                direction of the positive y axis, and the tail lights in the direction of the negative y axis.
            </li>
            <li>
                The axles should paint themselves so their center is at the origin, and the axles lie along the x axis.
                The right axle should be in the direction of the positive x axis.
            </li>
            <li>
                The tires should paint themselves with their center at the origin, and the "outside" of the tire (the
                side facing outside, rather than towards the car) is on the right side of the tire (in the direction
                of the positive x axis). Note that this means tires must also maintain information about whether they
                are on the right or left side of the car, so that a rotation transform can be applied, as necessary.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, each node will maintain an affine transform relative to its parent, which will be
            concatenated with the current transform (and applied to the context), before the node paints.
        </p>

        <p>
            These transforms merely set up the canvas for the individual parts to paint themselves. However, the
            individual
            parts may be further transformed by user interaction. As an example, the front tires can be steered left and
            right.
            You will want to track this transform separately from the other transforms (the provided source code is
            already
            set up to support this).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Implementation Details and Requirements
        </h2>

        <p>
            <strong><em>
                You must use affine transforms to manipulate the context when rendering the scene graph
                to the screen, and you must use affine transforms to perform hit testing (i.e.,
                to determine what the user is attempting to select when they press the mouse button). You must
                also create your car by constructing a scene graph, using the provided classes as a base.
            </em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            You can assume that this application will be used on a traditional desktop (or laptop) computer with
            a dedicated pointing device (like a mouse or trackpad). <em><strong>You do not need to support
            mobile devices, or devices with small screens (thus, you do not need to worry about responsive
            design). Your application only needs to work on a traditional computer.</strong></em>
        </p>


        <h3>
            Supporting Interaction Using Affine Transforms and the Scene Graph
        </h3>

        <p>
            While affine transforms may, at first, seem difficult, once you master them, this assignment will be
            rather straightforward.
        </p>

        <p>
            The key to using affine transforms in this assignment is to know that you (generally) concatenate
            the affine transform of each node to the current transform, as you descend the scene graph.
            Thus, you're typically saving the current context, grabbing a node's affine transform, concatenating it to
            the current transform,
            rendering, and then recursively doing the same for each child. When you're done with each node,
            you'll restore the saved context.
        </p>

        <p>
            We write "generally" and "typically" because if you leave a scaling transform intact, it will scale every
            child
            node thereafter, so you will generally not keep a scaling transform in place.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most important things to keep in mind is that the affine transforms and their inverses
            enable you to move between local and global (screen) coordinates. For example,
            given a transform to render the car to the screen, its inverse can be used to turn
            mouse events back into the model's original coordinate system (as long as the original transform doesn't do
            something
            like scale by 0).
        </p>

        <p>
            To assist with using affine transforms,
            we are providing an <a
                href="http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/class_goog_graphics_AffineTransform.html">
            affine transform module</a> from <a href="http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/index.html">Google's
            Closure library</a>. This module makes it relatively easy to create affine transforms and concatenate
            matrices. Note, however, that you will also need to interface with the 2D context object of the HTML 5
            canvas, so you will be working with affine transforms in two contexts: when rendering
            using the context object, and Google's affine transforms when interpreting input. Again, this is
            rather straightforward once you are comfortable with affine transforms.
        </p>

        <h3>Resizing the Buggy Using Affine Transforms</h3>

        <p>
            The assignment requires you to support resizing the car. There are several ways to implement this. The
            one you choose will depend on how you decide to render the car itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            One way to render the car is to have a graphic for the car, which is then scaled. This simply requires
            you to scale the context prior to painting the graphic. The drawback to this approach, as noted above, is
            that you can't keep that scaling transform in place as you descend the scene graph and paint children,
            because they, too, will then be scaled. Despite this drawback, scaling the context to properly stretch
            the car is a fine strategy to employ.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another way to render the car is to paint it using standard drawing operations (as opposed to using an image
            prepared ahead of time). For example, you could
            calculate the scaled dimensions of the car, and fill a rectangle of that size, without applying a scaling
            transform. However, you will still want to use affine transforms to represent
            these transformations, to make it easy to perform hit detection later.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may find the clip to be useful when drawing your car. See <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing">
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing</a> for more details. The
            clip
            grants you more control in painting different shapes.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Hit Detection
        </h3>

        <p>
            Hit detection is the process of determining whether the user's cursor is within a specific object
            in the scene. The complication, of course, is that the canvas's context will undergo several
            transformations as it descends the scene graph to paint children.
        </p>

        <p>
            Accordingly, as covered in class, what you'll need to do for every node is perform an inverse
            transformation of the screen coordinate to the object's local coordinate system, to see whether it
            falls within the object. <strong>While there are many other ways you could perform hit detection, this is
            the
            method you must implement for this assignment.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>
            Rotation
        </h3>

        <p>
            To determine rotation (for example, to allow the user to interactively turn the car's front wheels when
            they select them and drag the mouse), you will need to determine the change in angle from the time
            the user presses the mouse button. You will find
            the atan2 method of Javascript's built-in Math object useful for this.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Files
        </h3>

        <p>
            <a href="buggui.html">buggui.html</a> is the web page for your application, with
            <a href="js/buggui.js">buggui.js</a> the application's main entry point. <a href="js/scene_graph.js">scene_graph.js</a>
            should house your scene graph code. You should place all of your CSS in <a
                href="css/buggui.css">buggui.css</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast with previous assignments, you do not need to make a strict separation of model and view code.
            Instead, you can respond to all input at a global level, rather than a local, widget/component-level.
            However, you will still need to use the scene graph and affine transforms to do things like render
            objects and perform hit detection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite there not being a strict separation of model and view, you still need to make your architecture
            modular. In particular, you will need to follow the class specifications given, so we can swap out
            objects representing different car parts.
        </p>

        <h3>Marking Button and Unit Tests</h3>

        <p>
            You'll note in the HTML that we include a marking button and a link to unit tests. Neither
            of these should be altered or removed. They will allow us to programmatically test and manipulate
            your application for marking purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Bugs</h2>

        <p>
            As with any software, there are bound to be bugs in the code, and ambiguities in
            the specifications. We will respond to any bugs or questions and offer corrections
            and clarifications as needed.

            unit tests at marking time, to further test your code.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Will Test for Marking</h3>

        <p>
            We will be testing your scene graph to ensure it works as specified. For example, for this assignment, we
            may
            change the tire nodes with our own, or validate that affine transforms are correctly specified throughout
            the scene graph.
        </p>

        <h3>Assignment Constraints</h3>

        <p>
            You must complete the assignment within the following constraints:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>You must use only HTML, JavaScript and CSS that you, yourself, have created.
                <em>You may not use any other third-party JavaScript or CSS files for this assignment, including
                    web frameworks and code generation tools (with the exception of CSS preprocessors, though
                    you won't really have much use for them in this assignment).</em> However, we have included
                underscore.js
                and Google Closure's affine transforms for you to use.
            </li>

            <li>
                This is a single-page web application: <em>there should be only one web page that the user loads
                and interacts with -- they should never leave it</em> (with the exception of the unit tests).
                <em>We will take off significant marks if you redirect the user to another page.</em>
            </li>

            <li>
                All of your JavaScript files should work with (and include) <code>'use strict';</code>.
            </li>

            <li>
                You must use the convention in the code of creating functions that return your classes, to
                create modules.
            </li>

            <li>
                You may use <em>code snippets</em> from third-party sources, but no external libraries (HTML, JS,
                or CSS), or external code-generation tools. You must cite the use of any
                third-party code (including a URL if the example was obtained online).
            </li>

            <li>
                Your assignment may not make use of any external files loaded over the Internet. It will be
                tested locally, in offline mode.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Marking</h2>

        <p>
            To receive a great mark, you must implement the system as described above, under the given constraints,
            with all unit tests passing, while having an aesthetically pleasing design and a great user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note this assignment provides less guidance on the ultimate interface and interaction design: You may find
            that you need to spend more time on these aspects than in previous assignments.
        </p>

        <p>
            TAs will mark your assignment using the latest version of Chrome on whatever platform
            they use on a daily basis. In theory, the specific platform shouldn't matter. If we
            find platform differences, we'll handle them as they arise. They will mark the assignment
            in "offline" mode (i.e., with no access to the Internet).
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>How to Submit</h2>
        You will use subversion to both check out and submit your assignment. Details can be found on the
        <a href="https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS349/w15/about.html#svn">course website</a>.
